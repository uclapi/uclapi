# Secret key for Django to use. Auto-generate this and keep it secret!
SECRET_KEY=
# Root of Shibboleth's authentication. The example below might apply to fakeshibboleth;
# an actual example would be https://uclapi.com/Shibboleth.sso
# Be careful not to add a final /, as URLs like /Shibboleth.sso//Login will be generated,
# which will cause Shibboleth errors.
# To test using fakeshibboleth, use the value http://localhost:8001
SHIBBOLETH_ROOT=

# Whether we are running in production. This defines whether we have debug enabled, etc.
UCLAPI_PRODUCTION=True

# The domain we are running on. This is used by Django's ALLOWED_HOSTS feature
UCLAPI_DOMAIN=uclapi.com

# Whether we are running behind Amazon's EC2 Elastic Load Balancer. If so, this
# switches on a feature to fetch the local ipv4 address assigned by EC2 so that
# health checks and internal connections work as intended.
# See https://dryan.com/articles/elb-django-allowed-hosts/ for more info.
UCLAPI_RUNNING_ON_AWS_ELB=False

# Set URLs that may not be used as callback URLs (for security reasons).
UCLAPI_OAUTH_CALLBACK_DENIED_URLS=localhost;127.0.0.1

# Set which protocols may be used as callbacks. Intentionally separate them out
# so that http can be removed in production (but perhaps permitted in Staging)
