# Storage of the scope map
# The purpose of this setup is that the OAuth scope of any app can be stored
# in a single field. This way, we can easily add more scopes later.
# We have a BigIntegerField to work with, which means 64 bits of storage.
# This translates into 64 types of scope, each of which can be checked with a
# bit mask.
# E.g. roombookings has scope 0, which is
# 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001b.
# This is because the 0th bit (LSB) is set to 1.
# roombookings + uclu = 101b, or a scope number of 2^2 + 2^0 = 4 + 1 = 5
