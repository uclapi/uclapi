      Finding a place to get your work done
      can be hard. Every place you've thought of is somehow already filled
      up: the libraries, the study pods, the benches outside the Print Room
      CafÃ©, etc.
    </p>

    <p className='description'>
      Room Buddy makes use of UCL API to find
      and direct you to open study spaces that aren't widely known.

      with your UCL ID, and get going to the closest available space to
      your current location!

      who are looking for that extra guidance to pick the right modules, to applicants
      who want to find out more about student satisfaction in the modules
      they're interested in. And importantly, Unikomet can also be an extremely
      valuable tool through which students at large can express their opinions about
      something that is so important.
