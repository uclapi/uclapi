          <p>Welcome to the documentation for UCL‚Äôs brand new open API. Each service is listed below with examples in three different programming languages (Shell script using cURL, Python and JavaScript) to help you get going as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p>The API will be made up of several services, each of which will be separately versioned and explained. Every service will be documented here with important information, tips and examples.</p>

          <h2 id="get-api-key">Get Your API Key</h2>
          <p>
            Before you can use the API you should head to the API Dashboard and sign up using your UCL user account. Once logged into the dashboard simply name your app and you‚Äôll be given a key that you can use to access all the services. Simples!
          </p>

          <h2 id="api-rate-limits">API Rate Limits</h2>
          <p>
            Rate limiting of the API is primarily on a per-user basis. The limit is calculated against user‚Äôs ID (e-mail) across all access tokens.
          </p>
          <p>
            The limit is 10 000 requests per day and resets every day midnight London time. (00:00 GMT)
          </p>
          <p>
            When a request is throttled, the response returned by the server has HTTP Status Code ‚Äú429 Too Many Requests‚Äù. It includes a Retry-After header with the number of seconds the client is throttled for.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you would like your rate limit to be increased, contact us at isd.apiteam@ucl.ac.uk
          </p>

          <h2 id="api-expiry-times">API Data Freshness</h2>
          <p>
            Much of the data available from the API is served from cache. Bookings and Timetable data are updated every twenty minutes from UCL, and we update the Library Study Spaces (Workspaces) API every two minutes. The `Last-Modified` header will provide the time that the most recent caching operation completed in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/21121453">RFC 2616</a> format. Endpoints that do not rely on cached data will return the current timestamp in this field instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            This allows your application to judge whether the data is stale, or might need refreshing. For example, if a booking is added to the database and the data you are using is more than twenty minutes old, it may be that the booking is not visible to you yet. Consider creating a fresh request in this case.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you notice that the `Last-Modified` timestamp you see is unreasonably old, please get in contact with us ASAP to report this as it may indicate very stale data and an issue at our end.
