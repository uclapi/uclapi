        <p>
          Welcome to the documentation for UCL‚Äôs brand new open API.
          Each service is listed below with examples in three different
          programming languages (Shell script using cURL, Python and JavaScript)
          to help you get going as quickly as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          The API will be made up of several services,
          each of which will be separately explained.
          Every service will be documented here with important information,
          tips and examples.
        </p>

        <h2 id="get-api-key">Get Your API Key</h2>
        <p>
          Before you can use the API you should head to the API Dashboard
          and sign up using your UCL user account.
          Once logged into the dashboard simply name your app
          and you‚Äôll be given a key that you can use to access all the services.
          Simple!
        </p>

        <h2 id="rate-limits">API Rate Limits</h2>
        <p>
          Rate limiting of the API is primarily on a per-user basis.
          The limit is calculated against the user,
          across all their access tokens.
        </p>
        <p>
          The limit is 10,000 requests per day and resets every day
          at midnight, London time.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a request is throttled, the response returned by the server
          has HTTP Status Code ‚Äú429 Too Many Requests‚Äù.
          It includes a Retry-After header with the number of seconds
          the client is throttled for.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like your rate limit to be increased,
          contact us at&nbsp;
          <a href="mailto:isd.apiteam@ucl.ac.uk">isd.apiteam@ucl.ac.uk</a>
        </p>

        <h2 id="expiry-times">API Data Freshness</h2>
        <p>
          Much of the data available from the API is served from cache.
          Bookings and Timetable data are updated every twenty minutes from UCL,
          and we update the Library Study Spaces (Workspaces) API
          every two minutes.
          The <code>Last-Modified</code> header will provide the time that
          the most recent caching operation completed in&nbsp;
          <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/21121453">RFC 2616</a>
          &nbsp;format.
          Endpoints that do not rely on cached data will return the
          current timestamp in this field instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          This allows your application to judge whether the data is stale,
          or might need refreshing.
          For example, if a booking is added to the database and the data
          you are using is more than twenty minutes old, it may be that the
          booking is not visible to you yet.
          Consider creating a fresh request in this case.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you notice that the <code>Last-Modified</code> timestamp you see
          is unreasonably old, please get in contact with us ASAP to report this
          as it may indicate very stale data and an issue at our end.
