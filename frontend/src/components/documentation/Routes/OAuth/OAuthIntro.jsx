    <p id="oauth/meta">This is a quick guide to OAuth support in UCL API for developers. OAuth is a protocol that lets external apps request secure access to private UCL account data without getting your password. This can be done with a “Sign In With UCL” button on your website which avoids UCL users from needing to set up another account username and password. It also allows you as a developer to, for example, get a user’s personal timetable.</p>
    <p>Sounds intriguing? Demo of “Sign In With UCL” is located <a href="https://uclapi-oauth-demo.glitch.me/">here</a></p>

    <h1>Sign In With UCL Button</h1>
    <p>
      If you want to add a “Sign In With UCL” button to your website, which looks like this:
          </p>

    <img width={`100%`} src={signInButton} />

    <p>
      you can copy the following the following code: <br />
      where <code>CLIENT_ID</code> and <code>STATE</code> should be replaced by <code>client_id</code> of your app and a random <code>state</code>.
          </p>

    <h1 id="oauth/scopes">Scopes</h1>
    <p>
      OAuth scopes specify how your app needs to access a UCL user’s account. As an app developer, you set the desired scopes in the <a href="https://uclapi.com/dashboard">API Dashboard</a>. When a user is responding to your authorisation request, the requested scopes will be displayed to the user.
          </p>

    <h1>OAuth Workflow</h1>
    <p>If your application wants to use OAuth, you must set a callback URL in the dashboard. Then the app should follow this procedure:</p>
    <p>1. Send a request to <code>https://uclapi.com/oauth/authorise</code> with <code>state</code> and the application’s <code>client_id</code>.</p>
    <p>2. The user will need to log in with their UCL credentials on the UCL Single Sign-on website (if not logged in already).</p>
    <p>3. The user will be allowed to either authorise or deny the application, based on the OAuth scope requested. If the application is authorised, the callback URL receives <code>client_id</code>, <code>state</code> (specified in 1.), <code>result</code>, and <code>code</code>.</p>

    <p>If the application is denied, the callback URL receives <code>result</code> and <code>state</code>, and no private data will be provided to the application.</p>
    <p>1. To receive the OAuth user token (for performing actions on user’s behalf), we require <code>code</code> (from 3.), <code>client_id</code>, and <code>client_secret</code>. These should then be sent to <code>https://uclapi.com/oauth/token</code>, which will return a response containing <code>state</code>, <code>ok</code>, <code>client_id</code>, <code>token</code> (OAuth user token), and <code>scope</code> (scopes the app can access on the user’s behalf).</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> OAuth tokens and general API tokes are different. Whilst general API tokens can be used for all non-personal, generic data (such as room bookings), OAuth tokens must be used with an app&apos;s `client_secret` in order to retrieve personal data for a user. To make things easier, you can use personal OAuth tokens in place of general tokens once a user has logged into your app to retrieve generic data too.</p>
