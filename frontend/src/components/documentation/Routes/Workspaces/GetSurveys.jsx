                        This endpoint returns all UCL libraries with the Cad-Capture devices fitted to the seats. Each library is known as a 'survey', as it is a survey of the building. Within each survey there are multiple 'maps', each of which corresponds to a section such as a level, wing or separated library work area. Each sensor is tied to a specific map, and each map belongs to a survey.

If it is present, the <code>location[coordinates]</code> will generally be more precise.
