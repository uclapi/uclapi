        <p>
          UCL API is a platform for interacting with data that is usually
          difficult to obtain or hidden in internal UCL systems. The aim is to
          enable student developers to develop tools for other UCL students to
          enrich their lives at UCL. Almost every API returns JSON which is
          simple to parse and interpret in most modern programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is student-built platform, backed and supported by UCL&apos;s&nbsp;

            Information Services Division (ISD)
          </a>
          . This means that all of the features in UCL API have been developed by
          students and are aimed at students such as yourself, so jump right in!

      <p>
        You need to be affiliated with UCL because authentication (for both
       developers &amp; end users) is done via the UCL login system.

      <p>
        You do! We have no claim on your IP. However, we do request you include
        a shoutout somewhere. This helps raise awareness of UCL API and the vast
        amount of data available. It may not always be possible to include this
        attribution in an unintrusive manner (e.g. in a Slack bot), so
        we&apos;re flexible on this. The more people aware of UCL API and who
        use apps powered by UCL API, the better the platform will be. If you
        have any questions please feel free to reach out!
